# Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a machine learning model that could detect the mating call ("kick-ee-doo" or "kick-kick-ee-doo") of black rails from .wav files. 

## Background
The Eastern Black Rai (Laterallus jamaicensis jamaicensis) is a secretive marsh bird who historic range extended throughout most the the eastern United States. Black Rails were recently listed by the US Fish & Wildlife Service as Threatened; Florida has listed them as state-endangered. Black Rails primarily breed in shallow, heavily vegetated coastal marsh habitat; however, increased sea-level rise and urban development has drastically reduced the breeding population. Florida boasts a wide variety of non-traditional Black Rail habitat: stormwater treatment areas, impoundments, and non-tidal, interior marhses. Because Black Rails are small, cryptic, and less vocal than other marsh birds, standard visual and audial surveys are often ineffective. Autonomous recording units (ARUs) are increasingly being utilized by scientists to monitor Black Rails because they are relatively cheap, easy to deploy, and can be programmed to record throughout the day and night. However, ARUs can easily accrue hundreds of hours of recordings, which are onerous and time-consuming to sift through.
